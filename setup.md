# XML editor
You will need to use an XML text editor. We recommend Oxygen XML, if available.

Free alternatives include [JEdit](http://www.jedit.org/index.php?page=download) and 
[TEI Web Editor](https://tei-web-editor.herokuapp.com). 

- JEdit is a free text editor that works on any platform and includes syntax highlighting for XML and TEI code.
- TEI Web Editor is an online tool in which you can input TEI and see how it would display. 
  It doesn’t have all the functionality of Oxygen, 
  but it’s also not as complex to learn if you just want to see how things would look.

### Installing Oxygen

Download Oxygen to your (work) computer – you can find it in 
The University of Manchester [Software Centre](http://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/software/).
